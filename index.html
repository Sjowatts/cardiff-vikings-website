     <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>Welcome to the official website of the Cardiff Vikings basketball team.</p>

        <p> We are the Cardiff Vikings, a dynamic and passionate group of over 15 dedicated players who first came together at university and are committed to continuing our basketball journey beyond those years. 
        
        <p> Our team is the realization of a long-held dream and a passion project that our owner Sam Watts had. 
            
        <p>He is driven by his deep love for the sport and has been actively involved in basketball from a young age, starting as a coach at just 12 years old and participating in various sports for as long as I can remember.

        <p>With a master's degree in performance analysis, he brings a wealth of expertise to the team also acting as the Head Coach and a player, aiming to elevate the Cardiff Vikings to new heights. 
            
        <p>His vision for the club extends beyond just playing; “I aspire to establish a professional environment where we can apply advanced techniques and strategies to our game. Ultimately, my goal is to turn this passion into a full-time career, dedicating myself entirely to the development and success of the club”.
            
        <p> Looking ahead, the future of the Cardiff Vikings is bright and ambitious. We plan to expand our structure to include multiple teams leveling across an array of differnt leagues in Cardiff, providing opportunities for growth and progression within the sport. 
            
        <p> Our ultimate aim is to ascend the basketball ladder and secure a place in the prestigious British Basketball League. Furthermore, we are committed to inclusivity and community engagement, which is why adding women's and junior teams to our club is a top priority. 
            
        <p> By doing so, we hope to become a cornerstone of our community, fostering a love for basketball across all ages and genders, and making a positive impact both on and off the court.
            </p>
