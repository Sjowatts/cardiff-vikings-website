import pandas as pd

# Replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the path to your Excel file
file_path = 'your_file.xlsx'

# Replace 'Sheet1' with the name of the sheet you want to read
sheet_name = 'Sheet1'

# Read the Excel file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)

# Now you can work with the DataFrame 'df', which contains the data from the Excel sheet
# For example, you can print the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
